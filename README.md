## Quick Start (No Installation Required!)

**üöÄ You can use Safe Commander MCP without installing it globally on your machine!**

Just add this configuration to your MCP client and you're ready to go:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "safe-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "safe-commander-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_PATH": "/path/to/your/project",
        "ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "npm,git,ls,cat,pwd,node"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! The `npx -y` command will automatically download and run the latest version when needed.

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Example | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ALLOWED_PATH` | ‚úÖ **Yes** | `/Users/yourname/projects/my-app` | Directory where commands can be executed (use absolute path) |
| `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` | No | `npm,git,ls,cat,pwd,node,python` | Comma-separated list of allowed commands |

### Claude Desktop Setup

**Step 1:** Open your Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Step 2:** Add the Safe Commander MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "safe-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "safe-commander-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_PATH": "/Users/yourname/projects/my-project",
        "ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "npm,yarn,git,ls,cat,pwd,node,python,pip"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** Replace `/Users/yourname/projects/my-project` with your actual project path.

**Step 4:** Restart Claude Desktop.

**Step 5:** Test by asking: *"What commands are available?"*

### Other MCP Clients

For other MCP clients, use the same configuration format. The key points:
- **Command**: `npx`
- **Args**: `["-y", "safe-commander-mcp"]`
- **Environment**: Set `ALLOWED_PATH` and optionally `ALLOWED_COMMANDS`

## Real-World Examples

### For Web Development
```json
"ALLOWED_PATH": "/Users/yourname/projects/my-web-app"
"ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "npm,yarn,git,ls,cat,pwd,node,npx"
```

### For Python Development
```json
"ALLOWED_PATH": "/Users/yourname/projects/my-python-app"
"ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "python,pip,git,ls,cat,pwd,python3,poetry"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` can be customized to include any commands you need, but **carefully review each command** before adding it. More powerful commands enable more capable LLM assistance, but also introduce greater security risks. Always follow the principle of least privilege - only allow commands that are actually needed for your project.

### For Full-Stack Development
```json
"ALLOWED_PATH": "/Users/yourname/projects"
"ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "npm,yarn,python,pip,git,ls,cat,pwd,node,docker,make,curl"
```

**üîí Security Reminder**: This example includes powerful commands like `docker`, `make`, and `curl`. Only include commands you actually need and understand. Each additional command expands the potential attack surface.

Use these environment variable values in the main MCP configuration shown in the [Claude Desktop Setup](#claude-desktop-setup) section above.

## Alternative Installation Methods

### If You Prefer Global Installation

If you want to install globally first (optional):

```bash
npm install -g safe-commander-mcp
```

Then use `"command": "safe-commander-mcp"` instead of the npx approach in your MCP configuration.

### For Development/Contributing

If you want to contribute to Safe Commander MCP or develop new features:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nonameb3/safe-commander-mcp.git
cd safe-commander-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run in development mode (with file watching)
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Check TypeScript types
npm run lint
```

This setup allows you to modify the source code and test changes locally before contributing back to the project.

## Usage Examples

### Intelligent Command Discovery (NEW!)

Claude can now proactively discover and suggest commands without guessing:

```
"What commands are available in this project?"
"Show me the available package management commands"
"List all development tools I can use here"
"What are my options for version control operations?"
```

The `list_available_commands` tool provides:
- **Command Categories**: Organized by type (package management, version control, file operations, etc.)
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Explanation of what each command does
- **Configuration Info**: Current working directory, resource limits, and timeouts
- **Usage Statistics**: Command counts and category summaries

### Basic Command Execution

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant to run commands:

```
"Run npm install in the project directory"
"Show me the git status"
"List the files in the current directory"
"Run the build script with npm run build"
```

### Safe Commands

The following commands are safe by default:
- `npm` - Package management and script execution
- `git` - Version control operations
- `ls` - Directory listing
- `cat` - File content reading
- `pwd` - Current directory
- `node` - Node.js script execution

### Custom Command Configuration

You can customize allowed commands for your specific needs, but always review each command carefully:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ALLOWED_PATH": "/path/to/project",
    "ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "npm,yarn,pnpm,git,ls,cat,pwd,node,python,pip,poetry"
  }
}
```

**üõ°Ô∏è Security Guidelines for Command Selection:**
- **Start minimal**: Begin with only the commands you know you need
- **Add incrementally**: Add new commands only when required for specific tasks
- **Review regularly**: Periodically audit your command list and remove unused commands
- **Understand risks**: Research what each command can do before adding it
- **Principle of least privilege**: More powerful LLMs with more commands = greater capabilities but also greater risks

**Common command categories and their risk levels:**
- **Low risk**: `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `echo` - Read-only file operations
- **Medium risk**: `npm`, `git`, `node` - Development tools with limited system access
- **High risk**: `curl`, `wget`, `docker`, `sudo` - Network access or system-level operations

## Security Features

### Command Validation
- **Whitelist-only**: Only pre-approved commands can be executed
- **Character sanitization**: Dangerous characters (`; & | \` $ ( ) { } [ ] < >`) are blocked
- **Path validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Length limits**: Commands are limited to 1000 characters

### Resource Limits
- **Execution timeout**: 30 seconds maximum per command
- **Output size limit**: 1MB maximum output
- **Concurrent commands**: Maximum 3 simultaneous executions
- **Rate limiting**: 1-second cooldown between identical commands

### Directory Restrictions
All commands are executed within the configured `ALLOWED_PATH` directory, preventing access to sensitive system areas.

export ALLOWED_COMMANDS="ls,cat,pwd,echo"
yarn dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "ALLOWED_PATH directory does not exist"**
- Ensure the path exists and is accessible
- Use absolute paths for reliability

**Error: "Command contains potentially dangerous characters"**
- The command contains blocked characters for security
- Review the command for injection attempts

**Error: "Command not in allowed list"**
- Add the command to `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` environment variable
- Ensure proper comma separation in the list
- Use `list_available_commands` tool to see what's available (v1.1.0+)

**JSON parsing errors in MCP client**
- Ensure no `console.log()` usage (outputs to stdout)
- All logging goes to stderr via the `log()` function

### New Features (v1.1.0+)

**Command Discovery**: Use the `list_available_commands` tool to:
- See all available commands organized by category
- Get detailed descriptions of what each command does
- View current configuration and resource limits
- Understand the working directory and security settings

This eliminates guesswork and enables Claude to provide more intelligent assistance.
