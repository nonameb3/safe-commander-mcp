3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code lints (run `npx tsc --noEmit`)
5. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Yarn or npm
- TypeScript 5.8+

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nonameb3/safe-commander-mcp.git
   cd safe-commander-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables for testing**
   ```bash
   export ALLOWED_PATH="/tmp/safe-test-dir"
   export ALLOWED_COMMANDS="ls,cat,pwd,echo"
   mkdir -p /tmp/safe-test-dir
   ```

4. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

### Development Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Run in development mode with tsx
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn start` - Run built version
- `npx tsc --noEmit` - Type checking
- `yarn start:mcp` - Run with MCP inspector for debugging

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Use TypeScript strictly** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Define interfaces** for all data structures
- **Use proper error handling** with typed errors
- **Document complex functions** with JSDoc comments

### Security Guidelines

- **Never use `console.log()`** - All output must go to stderr via the `log()` function
- **Validate all inputs** - Especially commands and paths
- **Follow the principle of least privilege** - Restrict access as much as possible
- **Test security features thoroughly** - Ensure validation works correctly

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex logic

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test:` adding tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for Python commands
fix: prevent path traversal in file validation
docs: update installation instructions
security: enhance command sanitization
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test with valid configuration**
   ```bash
   ALLOWED_PATH="/tmp/safe-test" ALLOWED_COMMANDS="ls,cat" yarn dev
   ```

2. **Test with invalid configuration**
   ```bash
   ALLOWED_PATH="/nonexistent" yarn dev  # Should fail
   ```

3. **Test dangerous commands**
   - Try commands with dangerous characters
   - Test path traversal attempts
   - Verify rate limiting works

### Security Testing

Always test security features:
- Path traversal prevention
- Command injection protection
- Resource limits
- Rate limiting
- Startup validation
